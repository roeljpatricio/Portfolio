# Data Science portfolio

There are 3 different sections, Excel, SQL and Python. Each project is individually described. However, a brief description is provided below.

##  Excel
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/raw/main/Excel/Llamados%20linea%20137.xlsm) to download file  
Analyzis of the 137 line for domestic violence in Argentina. Dynamic tables, dynamic graphs and a simple time series analysis and feature analysis are carried out.  
Due to size github cannot display it, and it must be downloaded.  

## Python 

There are 2 subsections  

### Expectation Maximization[^1] 
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Expectation%20Maximization/EM%20jupyter.ipynb) to Jupyter Notebook  
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Expectation%20Maximization) to repository  
Collaborative Filters Via Gaussian Mixtures are explored. The EM algorithm is developed and a matrix with missing entries is filled  
The EM.zip file contains the directory files. It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/raw/main/Python/Expectation%20Maximization/em.zip) and 'EM Jupyter.ipynb' opened for full functionality.  



### High Dimensional Representation[^2]
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/High%20Dimensional%20Representation/High%20Dimensional%20Representation.pdf) to file  
t-SNE, PCA, K-means used for 2D representation of hyperdimensional data. Linear regression used for feature selection  
    
## SQL
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/BBDD%20sindicato.sql) to .sql file  
[link](https://github.com/roeljpatricio/Portfolio/tree/main/SQL) to repository  
Database implementation for a fictional union. Used for handling reservation of installations and record keeping of members
